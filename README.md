Thanks to [mattsoft from the nfggames forum](https://nfggames.com/forum2/index.php?topic=6510.0) for the original idea and implementation for the "Tetris-piece" X68000 OG/ACE power supply.

Thanks to [Tim Maxwell's ATX Breakout project](http://timmaxwell.org/pages/atx-breakout/) for contributing the symbol for the ATX connector. The footprint was taken from the old KiCad GitHub footprints repository.
